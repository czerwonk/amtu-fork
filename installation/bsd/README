DOCUMENTATION
===========================================================================

This is a brief README for BSD Systems.  For more detailed
documentation, please visit http://amtu.sourceforge.net/ to download the
latest User Guide in pdf format.

Please download the linux installation to use as a reference for installing
AMTU on BSD Systems.

Future support may come for BSD systems.  If you would like to add this support,
remember that AMTU is open source and you are welcome to do so.

The important things to note are that the scripts:

./service/bin/amt
./service/bin/amt_monitor

will need to be run to start these applications.  In the System V world, a
symlink to these scripts is put in /etc/init.d/ so that the applications can
be run as a daemon.
