DOCUMENTATION
===========================================================================

This is a quick and dirty README for linux installation.  For more detailed
documentation, please visit http://amtu.sourceforge.net/ to download the
latest User Guide in pdf format.

The above documentation should be read before proceeding with this
installation.  Although it is written for a Windows installation, it does
contain important information about AMTU configuration.

INSTALLATION
===========================================================================

The following readme assumes that your current working directory is the
directory where this README was found.

Before running the installation, it is a good idea to run the uninstallation
to clean up any artifacts of previous installations.  This needs to be run as
root since the uninstallation script will be editing /etc/init.d/ and 
/etc/rcX.d. directories:

sudo ./uninstall.sh

The installation also needs to run as root.  Therefore, some of the scripts
will need to be editted unless root already has a $JAVA_HOME environment
variable set and the $PATH variable includes $JAVA_HOME/bin.

Necessary script modifications:

1.  In ./install.sh (the installation script in the same directory as this 
readme), change:

export JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME

to read: 

export JAVA_HOME=/your/java/installation 

and uncomment:

# export PATH=$JAVA_HOME:$PATH

2.  In ./service/conf/amt.conf and ./service/conf/monitor.conf, change:

wrapper.java.command=java 

to be whatever command root would have to run to run java.  
If java isn't found in the $PATH environment variable, then
wrapper.java.command will likely have to point to an absolute path to java.

Note that step 1 and 2 would be much simpler if root's environment knew
something about java.  Step 1 is necessary because the installation is run
as root.  Step 2 is necessary because the amt/monitor daemons are run as root.

Once the above modifications are made, run:

sudo ./install.sh

from the directory containing this README.

This script will install amt and amt_monitor as daemons, configure
the application, and start the daemons.
