This is a quick and dirty README for linux installation:

The installation needs to run as root.  Therefore, some of the scripts
will need to be editted unless root already has a $JAVA_HOME environment
variable set, and the $PATH variable includes $JAVA_HOME/bin.

Necessary modifications:

1.  In ./install.sh (the installation script in the same directory as this 
readme), change 'export JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME' to read 
'export JAVA_HOME=/your/java/installation' and uncomment 
'# export PATH=$JAVA_HOME:$PATH'.

2.  In ./service/conf/amt.conf and ./service/conf/monitor.conf, change
wrapper.java.command=java to be whatever command root would have to run
to run java.  If java isn't found in the $PATH environment variable, then
wrapper.java.command will likely have to point to an absolute path to java.

Note that step 1 and 2 would be much simpler if root's environment knew
something about java.  Step 1 is necessary because the installation is run
as root.  Step 2 is necessary because the amt/monitor daemons are run as root.

Once the above modifications are made, run 'sudo ./install.sh' from this
directory.
